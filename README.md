The Spotify Streaming Trends site is a website that allows Spotify executives to understand and analyze trends to promote informed business decisions. We use the dataset that includes the top 200 songs per day in 2017. 

The **Sex, Drugs, and Rock'n'Roll** page was created by Ollie Downs. They found that classic topics in music allow us to draw several important conclusions about the state of music in 2017.


The **Weekly and Monthly Trends** page was created by Michael Steckler. His main finding is that ad slots can be priced  dynamically according to genre- and temporal-specific listening trends.


The **Sentiment Analysis and NLP Algorithm** page was created by Chelsea Shu. She uncovered that the NLP algorithm fails to capture the sentiment of foreign languages, and therefore needs to be improved.


The **Gender in Streams** page was created by Emma Russon. She found that different metrics for popularity lead to different actionable insights, while shining light on the gender disparities in the music industry.
