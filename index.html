  <h1> Spotify Streaming Trends </h1>

  <h2> Introduction </h2>

  <hr>

  <p> Welcome, Spotify Executives! </p>

  <p> 2017 was a big year for music. This is a website dedicated to the exploration of the global music scene in that year. Our task was to explore the data we have about song streams for every day of that year in order to build solutions to future problems. </p>

  <p> The data we're using is from online sources such as Kaggle and Genius.com that contain the top 200 songs streamed in each of several countries every day in 2017, along with those songs' lyrics and artist details. We used a NLP algorithm to compute the sentiments of each song. </p>

  <p> In this set of visualizations, we explore a classic set of topics: Sex, Drugs, and Rock'n'Roll, Weekly and Monthly Trends, Sentiment Analysis and the NLP Algorithm, and Gender in Streams. </p>

  <p> Let the analysis begin! Use the navigation bar at the top of the screen to explore these four topics. </p>

  <h2> Insights </h2>

  <p> The goal of this website is to show you the results of our data exploration. The results are as follows: </p>

  <ul>
    <li> Sex, Drugs, and Rock'n'Roll, classic topics in music, allow us to draw several important conclusions about the state of music in 2017. </li>
    <li> Price ad slots dynamically according to genre and temporal-specific listening trends. </li>
    <li> The NLP algorithm fails to capture the sentiment of foreign languages. </li>
    <li> Different metrics for popularity lead to different actionable insights, while shining light on the gender disparities in the music industry. </li>
  </ul>
